# How to create a Capsule collection

Collections are repositories where Capsules are stored.

Follow these steps to create a collection:

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don’t create a collection, the Capsule is saved in the **Default** collection. You can [move the Capsule to another collection](../how-to-change-a-capsule-collection-or-group.md) after you have saved it.
{% endhint %}

1. On the **Build** page, click the **Capsules** tab.
2. Click the **Create** button in the upper right corner.
3. Select the **Create Collection** option.

4. In the configuration form, fill in the **Collection name** and **Collection description** fields.
5. Activate the **Open Collection** option to allow users outside your organization to use the Capsules in the collection. Otherwise, leave the option deactivated.
6. In the **Header** section, select an existing header from the list. Headers help identify the collection to which a Capsule belongs. To add a new header to the list, you must perform the following steps:
   1. Click on **Settings** in the upper right corner of the platform’s home page.
   2. Open the **Capsules** option in the left sidebar.
   3. Click **Create** to add the header. Learn more about the [Capsule header dimensions](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/build/capsulas/how-to-use-capsules/how-to-create-a-capsule-collection/capsule-header-dimensions).
   4. Once you have added the header, you can select it in the collection creation form.
7. In **Background color**, select a color that represents the collection. This color will be used in the icons of the Capsules after they are saved.
8. Click **Save** to add the new collection to the list in the left sidebar.

Once the collection is created, move the mouse pointer to the collection name in the left sidebar and click the three-dot icon button to display the following options:

* **New group:** create a [new group](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/build/capsulas/how-to-use-capsules/how-to-create-a-capsule-group) within the collection.
* **Edit collection:** edit the collection’s configuration form.
* **Delete collection:** delete the collection. Only collections without active Capsules can be deleted.
