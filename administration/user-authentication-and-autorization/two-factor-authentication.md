# How to activate and deactivate two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication is a feature that provides additional protection and ensures secure access to any system.

On the Digibee Integration Platform, it is possible to activate two-factor authentication on the Platform itself to protect your login. See the steps below.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your access is through an [identity provider](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/administration/identity-provider-integration/how-to-integrate-the-identity-provider) that is already integrated with the Digibee Integration Platform, this authentication feature is not required.
{% endhint %}

## **How to activate the two-factor** authentication

1. Log in to the Digibee Integration Platform.
2. Click the user menu in the upper right corner.
3. Click **Two-factor authentication.**
4. Select the authentication app and download it to your phone.
5. Open the selected app, scan the QR code and enter the code that appears in the app.
6. Click **Activate.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important information:**

* Download the authentication app (_Google Authenticator,_ _Microsoft Authenticator_, or _LastPass Password Manager_) using your smartphone operating system store.
* Once you click **Activate**, the Platform will redirect the user to a deactivation page. It is only necessary to fill in this page if the purpose is to disable the feature.
{% endhint %}
