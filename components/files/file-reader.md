# File Reader

**File Reader** reads a local file and converts it into a JSON structure that can be manipulated inside the pipeline. The component supports the reading of multi-line text files or binary files.&#x20;

## Parameters

Take a look at the configuration options for the component. Parameters supported by [Double Braces expressions](../../build/double-braces/) are marked with `(DB)`.

## How are text files read? <a href="#how-are-text-files-read" id="how-are-text-files-read"></a>

The text files are read line by line. A structure is formed at the component output, with all the read lines:

```
{

"data" : [

 "line 1",

 "line 2",

 ...

],

"fileName": "",

"lineCount": 0

}
```

* **data:** has a JSON array of converted lines.
* **filename:** name of the file use as source for the component.
* **lineCount:** amount of line read from the file.

If the **Read As A Single String** parameter is activated, then the returned structure will contain all the lines from the file read in one unique string:

```
{

"data" : [

 "line 1\r\nline2\r\nline n\r\n"

],

"fileName": "",

"lineCount": 1

}
```

Notice that, in this case, the lines reading includes one or more line break characters. Generally, if the file is created in Unix-based systems, only the line break with `\n` will be returned. On the other hand, if the file is created in Windows-based systems, the line break with `\r\n` will be returned.

## Handling a characters set (Charset) <a href="#handling-a-characters-set-charset" id="handling-a-characters-set-charset"></a>

For text files to be read, itâ€™s important to set the charset with the same value that was used during the creation of the file. If an incompatible characters set is used, the file might be read and misinterpreted. That takes to imprecisions with special characters, such as accented letters and others.   &#x20;

## How are binary files read? <a href="#how-are-binary-files-read" id="how-are-binary-files-read"></a>

Binary files can't have their content naturally expressed in properties inside JSON messages, once many binary characters aren't "printable". That way, the content of binary files is transformed into a base64 string:

```
{

"data" : "VGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QuCg==",

"fileName": "",

"lineCount": 0

}
```

Notice that, in the example above, the "data" property isn't presented as an array, but as a single base64 string.

The manipulation of files inside a pipeline is made in a protected way. All the files are accessed through one temporary directory only, that is created at each pipeline execution.
