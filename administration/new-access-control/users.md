# Users

Users are individuals who have access to the Digibee Integration Platform. Each user account is uniquely identified by its email.

## The Users page

The Users page shows you a table with the active and archived users in your realm.

You can list them all or search for them by name or email and also filter for archived users in the search bar. Note that a user can be archived and unarchived as often as you like.

You can view the status of your users and see which authentication and authorization rules have been set for them. As a User manager, you have access to a number of actions such as creating, editing, and archiving users.

In the **Actions** column, you can also reset the usersâ€™ passwords and deactivate the "Forgot password" button on the login page. Note that this is enabled by default, and you will need to ask the support team to configure it for you.

There is a **status** column to represent the user's situation, which can assume the values below:

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Status</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OK</td><td>Active users</td></tr><tr><td>Expired Password</td><td>Active users who need to reset their passwords</td></tr><tr><td>Archived</td><td>Archived users</td></tr><tr><td>Locked Login</td><td>Users whose login access to the Platform is locked</td></tr></tbody></table>

The **authentication rule** variable can assume the following values, listed below.&#x20;
