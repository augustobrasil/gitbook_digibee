# How to resolve names without a DNS - REST, SOAP, SAP (web protocols)

If you want to resolve a name - that is, a URL or an endpoint - without a public DNS in a particular component such as **REST V2**, **SOAP V3**, **SAP**, and others within the [Web Protocols](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/components/web-protocols) category, the Digibee Integration Platform has a feature that can help.

This feature allows you to explicitly map and redirect a hostname to an internal or external IP address. You can configure as many hosts as you need.

To activate the feature, follow these steps:

1. Configure the realmParameter by Environment.&#x20;
2. Send the URL and IP to our support team (via chat or email: support@digibee.com), according to your need. You can set different values for each Digibee Integration Platform environment (TEST or PROD).&#x20;
3. Once the configuration is finished, select the component you want to use and fill the URL parameter in the configuration form.
