# Digibee Customer Support

All customers have access to our Support team, who are well-equipped to assist with any questions or problems you may encounter. You can reach them via the chat in the top right corner of the Platform's homepage.

Select the **Support Access** option to allow or deny our Customer Support Team access to your realm. Please note that all users are affected by the support deactivation, so make sure that no incident or problem is open.

To learn more about contact channels, requirements, and the information needed for us to provide you with the service, access [Digibee Customer Support](https://intercom.help/godigibee/en/articles/6518706-digibee-customer-support) and [Digibee Customer Supportâ€™s Artificial Intelligence](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/general/digibee-customer-support/how-to-use-digibee-customer-supports-artificial-intelligence-intelligence) documentation.
