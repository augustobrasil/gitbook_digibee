# Triggers

A trigger is the activation condition of the pipeline, i.e. the first step to set a pipeline in motion - for example by an external call, in response to an event or via a schedule. \
\
Each pipeline must have a trigger and the components must be connected to each other. The type of trigger you use depends on what is the main task you want to complete with your pipeline.
