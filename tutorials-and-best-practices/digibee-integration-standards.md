# Digibee integration standards

{% hint style="info" %}
The complete document about Integrations Standard will be available soon.
{% endhint %}

At the Documentation Portal you have access to the standards used to build pipelines and to the good practices for fixing bugs, guaranteeing safety and managing events.&#x20;

In this portal you will also find articles that present and teach how to handle the components responsible for your flows integration.

We recommend you to read the [Pipelines: Building checklist](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/tutorials-and-best-practices/pipeline-building-checklist) article to get familiar with everything that's important to build pipelines.&#x20;

If you have any doubts related to any of our documentations, get in touch with our Support Team through the chat on Digibee Integration Platform.&#x20;
