# Public capsules

Public capsules are reusable components or integration sets that are made available to any customer or user of the platform. They are typically created, tested, and validated by the Digibee Integration Platform and cannot be edited to ensure quality and security.

Public capsules that have been created and validated by the Digibee Integration Platform are marked with a certificate icon, as shown in the following figure:

All collections and all [versions](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/build/capsulas/capsules-versioning) of each public capsule are available on the Capsules tab on the right side of the pipeline.&#x20;

To use a public capsule, drag the desired capsule onto the canvas.
