# Capacity and quotas

The Digibee Integration Platform works with technical usage limits, which are the limits of the resources that are allocated for each realm. These limits are designed to ensure the Platform's performance and best practices.

To better understand how limits are handled on the Platform, please read the full [Digibee Platform Technical Threshold and Limits](https://www.digibee.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Digibee-Platform-Technical-Usage-Limits-EN-US-02152024.pdf) document.
