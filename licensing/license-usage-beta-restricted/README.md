# License Usage

On the **License Usage** page, you can better manage and track your deployed pipelines and consumption. This applies to Licenses in the [Pipeline-based model](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/licensing/licensing-models/pipeline-based-model), RTUs in the [Subscription-based model](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/licensing/licensing-models/subscription-based-model), and Credits in the [Capacity-based model](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/licensing/licensing-models/capacity-based-model).

## Dashboard view

This dashboard displays information on the quantity of pipeline used, available quantity, and total acquired quantity, as well as the consumption of licenses, RTUs, or Credits, making it easier to control.

Additionally, at the bottom of the page, you will find a list of projects belonging to the realm and the selected environment, along with information about each project.

The list displays information such as the name and description of the project, the environment in which it is located, the number of pipelines deployed in the project, and the number of Licenses, RTUs, or Credits depending on the licensing model.

You can view more details about the project by clicking the **Actions** icon.
