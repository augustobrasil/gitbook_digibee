# How to create a Capsule group

Capsule groups are sections within collections to organize Capsules.

Follow these steps to create a group:

{% hint style="info" %}
You canâ€™t create a group if you have not yet [created a collection](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/build/capsulas/how-to-use-capsules/how-to-create-a-capsule-collection). In this case, the Capsule is saved in the **Default** collection and group, but you can [move it later](how-to-change-a-capsule-collection-or-group.md).
{% endhint %}

1. Move the mouse pointer over the name of the collection and click the three-dots icon.
2. Click the **New group** button.

3. In the pop-up window that opens on the screen, fill in the **Group name** field.
4. Click **Create**.

Once the group is created, hover over the group name in the left sidebar to display the following buttons:

* **Edit group:** edit the name of the group.
* **Delete group:** delete the group. Only empty groups can be deleted.
