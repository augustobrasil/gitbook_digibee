# How to activate group integrations

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Integration of IdP groups with Digibee groups** **feature** is currently in beta phase. Learn more about the [Beta Program](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/general/beta-program).
{% endhint %}

To activate group integrations:

1. Go to the **Administration** page.
2. Click on **Groups**.
3. Click on the **Group Integrations** tab.

A banner is displayed warning you that all users originated from the identity provider (IdP) must be included in a group integration to be able to access the Digibee Integration Platform. If youâ€™re sure your group integrations include all users you want to be able to access the platform:

4. Click on **ACTIVATE INTEGRATIONS**.
5. Select the group integrations you want to activate.
6. Click on **CONTINUE**.

If the selected group integrations do not have a **test status** equal to **success**, a warning message will appear. Learn more about test status in the article [Integration of IdP groups with Digibee groups](./).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Although you can activate group integrations without testing them first, we recommend that you always [test group integrations](how-to-test-a-group-integration.md) before you activate them.
{% endhint %}

Finally:

7. Fill in the confirmation message displayed;
8. Click on **ACTIVATE**.
