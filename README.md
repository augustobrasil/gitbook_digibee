## Digibee Academy

Digibee Academy is an initiative by Digibee to enhance the knowledge of professionals in integration contexts that include scenarios of internal IT challenges as well as external challenges with partners in its business ecosystem.

By applying our Simplexity Mindset methodology, we provide students with a different perspective on integrations so they can master the Digibee Integration Platform through training, certifications, and learning paths. This way, they can develop high-performance applications that consistently achieve a higher level of architecture and best practices.

The goal of Digibee Academy is to improve the learning of all users toward self-sufficiency.
