# Pipeline License Usage

Easily track your pipelines and available licenses with the **License Usage** feature, which lets you assess the number of pipelines in your realm and the total amount available. In addition, you can check the number of licenses available in your realm's test and prod environments to carry out deployments of your pipelines.\


## License usage overview

In the [Pipeline-based model](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/licensing/licensing-models/pipeline-based-model), you can track your usage and manage the pipelines and licenses available in your realm. To access this feature, go to `Settings` in the upper right corner, and then click on **License Usage** under `Subscription` in the lower left corner of the page.
