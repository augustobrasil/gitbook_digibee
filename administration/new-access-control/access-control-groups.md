# Groups

A group is a collection of users bound to one or more roles.

## The Groups page

{% hint style="info" %}
Only **active** users will be displayed in groups.
{% endhint %}

The Groups page shows you a table that shows the active groups in your realm.&#x20;

This table shows the group **name**, **description,** and the **number of members** in each group.

## Actions

### How to create a group

To create a group:

1. Click on the **Create** button, in the upper right corner;
2. Fill in the group name and description;
3. Click on the **+** icon to assign members to the new group (optional);

{% hint style="info" %}
You can add or remove members from a group at any time.
{% endhint %}

4. Click on **Save** to create the new group.

### How to bind a role to a group

{% hint style="info" %}
You must create the desired role before you bind it to a group. [Learn more about roles here](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/administration/new-access-control/access-control-roles).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To bind a role to a group:

1. Use the search bar or search the table for the group you want to assign a role to;
2. Click on the pencil icon in the **Actions** column;
3. On the **Permissions** tab, click on **+Binding**;
4. Select the desired role and the environment to which you want to assign the permissions of the role;
5. Click on **Save**;
6. Write a note describing the reasons for the changes you just made;
7. Click on **Edit** to confirm the action.

### How to archive a group

If you archive a group, it becomes inactive. The members of an archived group will lose the permissions granted by it.

To archive a group:

1. Use the search bar or search the table for the group you want to archive;
2. Click on the box icon in the **Actions** column;
3. Write a note describing the reasons for archiving the group;
4. Click on **Archive**.

### How to restore a group

Once a group is restored, it is no longer displayed under the archived groups list, but is visible on the active groups list. All previous permissions linked to a group are also restored. A group can be restored at any time.

Also, a group keeps the same users who are already part of it as long as they are active.

To restore a group:

1. Click on **Archived** in the dropdown menu on the search bar to see a list of all archived groups;
2. Use the search bar to find a specific group you want to restore or search for it in the available list;
3. Click on the **open box** icon in the group you want to restore;
4. Click the **Restore** button on the dialog box to confirm the action.

## Default groups

Besides creating your own groups, you can also use Digibeeâ€™s default groups. Each default group is bound to a set of system roles. These groups cover the most common user types of the Digibee Integration Platform.

Unlike [system roles](https://docs.digibee.com/documentation/administration/new-access-control/access-control-roles), default groups can be modified, deleted, and archived.
