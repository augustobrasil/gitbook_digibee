# Email Trigger

{% hint style="info" %}
This trigger supports IMAP protocol only, without attachments.
{% endhint %}

**Email Trigger** delivers data from an email inbox into the pipeline.

## Parameters

Take a look at the configuration parameters of the trigger. Parameters supported by [Double Braces expressions](../../build/double-braces/) are marked with `(DB)`.

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="239">Parameter</th><th>Description</th><th>Default value</th><th>Data type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Account</strong></td><td>Specify the account for the trigger to access the correct email.</td><td>N/A</td><td>String</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Operation</strong></td><td>Action to be executed by the trigger.

## **Operation**

* **Mark as Read:** select this option if, after being processed, you want the message to be marked as read.
* **Move to Another Folder:** select this option if, after being processed, you want the message to be moved to a predetermined folder. The destination is specified in the **Destination Email Folder** field, which only appears in the configurations when Move to Another Folder is selected.
* **Delete:** select this option if, after being processed, you want the message to be deleted.

## **Attachments**

If there are attachments in the body of the message received by the trigger, these are downloaded and made available in the pipeline's execution directory. The attachment names will be contained inside the `attachments` property and this property will be an array of strings containing the names of the attachments.

If there are 2 attachments with the same name in the message, a unique identifier will be added to the name of the downloaded attachment.

**Example:**

There are 2 attachments with the name "file.csv" inside the message. Therefore, the content of the `attachments` property will be:

```
{
"attachments": ["file.csv", "0072e485-8ba2-4f79-bba5-8068e37ee792_file.csv"]
}
```

The identifier varies at each execution.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use Gmail as IMAP server host, it will be necessary to authorize the support of less secure applications. Check [Google external documentation](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en) to see the step-by-step.
{% endhint %}
